3. Find and replace the old name with the new one, be sure to search in lowercase and uppercase.
4. Clean up your copied application and verify that the `your-app/docker/*` files meet your application's expectations.

8. Ready, now let's create a docker compose service in `.devo`. Let's go to [.devo/provisioning/apps](/.devo/provisioning/apps/)
and copy one of the files with the name of an existing application. Just like the previous steps, adapt the copied file.
7. **IMPORTANT!** The copied file must have the same name as its directory but in lowercase.
8. Check that your new app is added to the [databases](/.devo/provisioning/infrastructure/datasources/mongo/init-mongo.sh) that are created when starting MongoDB.
9. Lastly, build images before starting containers and re-run setup, run: `yarn devo start --build`
