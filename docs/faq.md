# FAQ

#### Why microservices and complex architecture for a project that is just starting?

We don't just want to know if Turnly is a great project, our approach is to be enthusiasts
of organized code and take the opportunity to do things slowly and elegantly. So instead
of just taking a repository and doing boring labs for separate concepts,
we decided to take an idea and bring it to life.

Although it is a new project, we decided to start with microservices to experience its
complications. We take a very serious approach, but our profit from learning comes first.

Until now, the things we have adopted have kept the spirit
of further developing this product alive.

#### Why don't you use Nest.js?

Nest.ts is a great framework but for our liking, it has a very strong structure
and the architecture we chose differs from certain things in Nest.js.

But don't be surprised if we use it in some service.

#### Why not use lerna or turbo?

When we started the project it was closed and we have no plans to release packages
from the monorepo to npm, so we use `yarn workspaces` because it works well for us.
