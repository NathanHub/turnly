# Turnly â€” What about Disaster Recovery?

Hopefully, this goes without saying, enterprise customers tend to view much of their software
as "critical" and will want to know that it has a reliable history of uptime and systems installed
for disaster recovery. That is why one of the main concerns is;
**What are we doing to handle downtime or error handling?**

This document is a short, technical version for members who interact with the systems.

#### Error handling and monitoring

We did a great job handling and catching any bugs in the app, however, this doesn't
prevent something unexpected from happening, but it will help you be prepared
and have a way to find a solution quickly.

Application errors are handled with the concept of Domain Exception and should
not be a cause for concern, however critical and unexpected errors will be handled by our
system that is responsible for creating logs, notifying the monitoring team in Slack and
sending the error to Sentry with all the necessary data to match the error to a request ID.

All requests have a unique identifier that helps track errors in the same transaction.

Sentry, Elastic, and Slack will be your source for monitoring to guide you in troubleshooting your systems.
