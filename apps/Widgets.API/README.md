# Widgets API â€” Backend for Frontend

Turnly Widgets is a live ticketing solution that helps businesses improve the
customer experience by allowing them to take turns (tickets) from their websites
in an interactive and simple way.

Widgets are the first apps to take turns (tickets) on the client-side,
but it is expected that the same experience can be transferred to mobile
clients, desktops, or even smartwatches.
