### The most notable features üì¶

##### Assistance Centers

Capability to manage multiple locations (branches), services offered, working hours,
desks for support, agents and managers per locations.

#### Custom Fields & Processors

Business data fields (custom fields) for the organizations to obtain the
necessary data according to their logic and internal processes.

A processor can be a lambda function or an external API that performs
validations or even data transformation.

#### Customer Reminders

Your customers will receive automatic notifications to keep
them aware of the life cycle of their tickets.

Capability of sending reminders (notifications) through different communication
channels, such as SMS, Push, Emails, Calls, or WhatsApp messages.

#### Customer Experience Rating

Your customers can send you feedback on how to improve the experience
in your locations (branches) or even give you the best rating, you can
use this data for service intelligence.

#### Partnership API

Our APIs are completely based on integration with external systems and
that is why we offer partner APIs that will allow you to create your own application flow.

Partner APIs, webhooks, and support for Beacons that integrate with mobile apps to detect customer arrival or create proximity-based logic.

#### Real Time Messaging API (Streaming data)

The RTM API is a WebSocket-based API that allows you to receive
read-only access to a selected set of data from Turnly in realtime.

Once your application establishes a connection to a streaming endpoint,
a feed of events is delivered to your app.

#### Custom Subdomain

Your organization gets a subdomain from Turnly.
The URL you get is the one you should use to interact with your organization's APIs and apps.

You will be able to use the following URLs to interact with the APIs:
