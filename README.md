# Athena â€” Monorepo of backend applications

We are building the next queue management and customer experience system
for walk-ins at physical locations.

We replace take-a-number systems with a web widget-based system, which your customers
can access via any device from your website. This allows you to offer a personalized service,
obtain prior information required for service, and collect data associated with
your customers for Service Intelligence.

in your locations (branches) or even give you the best rating, you can
use this data for service intelligence.

#### Partnership API

Our APIs are completely based on integration with external systems and
that is why we offer partner APIs that will allow you to create your own application flow.

Partner APIs, webhooks, and support for Beacons that integrate with mobile apps to detect customer arrival or create proximity-based logic.

#### Real Time Messaging API (Streaming data)

The RTM API is a WebSocket-based API that allows you to receive
read-only access to a selected set of data from Turnly in realtime.

Once your application establishes a connection to a streaming endpoint,
a feed of events is delivered to your app.
